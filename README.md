## Introduction

*This is a fork of [dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim), which is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that moves from a single file to a multi file configuration.*

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Modular
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.
